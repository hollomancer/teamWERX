# teamWERX Specification Feedback

After implementing the Node.js scaffold for teamWERX, here are my observations and suggestions for improving the specification:

## Strengths

1. **Clear Architecture**: The separation between configuration (AGENTS.md) and artifacts (.teamwerx/) is well thought out
2. **Git Integration**: Using git as the versioning system is a smart choice - leverages existing tools
3. **AI-First Design**: The specification clearly identifies which commands are meant for AI agents
4. **Token Efficiency**: Minimizing configuration in AGENTS.md frontmatter to reduce token usage is practical
5. **Workflow Structure**: The four-phase workflow (Goal → Research → Plan → Execute) is logical and intuitive

## Opportunities for Improvement

### 1. Command Interface Clarity

**Issue**: The specification mentions "slash commands" (e.g., `/teamwerx.goal`) but this is more of a notation than the actual interface.

**Suggestion**: Clarify that:
- Slash notation is for documentation/AI agent instructions
- Actual CLI usage is `teamwerx <command>` (standard CLI convention)
- Consider documenting both forms clearly in the spec

### 2. Proposal Workflow Complexity

**Issue**: The proposal workflow includes approve/reject commands, but the spec doesn't clarify:
- Who has "appropriate permissions" in a single-developer tool?
- How should conflicts be resolved between AI agents?
- What "automatically merged" means technically

**Suggestions**:
- Simplify to a review-accept model for single developer
- Make it clear that the developer is always the final authority
- Remove or clarify the "appropriate permissions" language
- Define what "merge" means (file replacement? git merge? manual copy?)

### 3. State Transition Automation

**Issue**: The spec mentions automated state transitions (e.g., "executing a plan might change state to in-progress") but doesn't specify:
- Which commands trigger which transitions
- Whether transitions are automatic or require confirmation
- How to handle invalid transitions

**Suggestions**:
- Add a table mapping commands to state transitions
- Specify that transitions should be automatic but reversible via git
- Add validation to prevent invalid state transitions
- Consider adding explicit state transition commands (start, complete, block, cancel)

### 4. AI Agent Command Execution

**Issue**: Commands like `research`, `discuss`, `plan`, etc. are designed for AI agents, but the implementation path isn't clear:
- Should these commands output templates for AI agents to fill?
- Should they validate AI-generated content?
- How should errors in AI-generated content be handled?

**Suggestions**:
- Provide template/schema for each AI-generated artifact
- Add validation for required fields in AI-generated content
- Consider adding a `--dry-run` flag to preview what the AI should generate
- Add examples of expected AI output for each command

### 5. Goal Dependencies

**Issue**: The spec mentions goal dependencies in an example but doesn't formalize:
- How dependencies are declared
- How dependency validation works
- What happens if you try to execute a goal with unmet dependencies

**Suggestions**:
- Add a `dependencies` field to the goal schema
- Add a `teamwerx validate` command to check dependency status
- Prevent execution of goals with incomplete dependencies
- Show dependency tree in `teamwerx status`

### 6. Multi-Goal Coordination

**Issue**: While the spec supports multiple goals, it doesn't address:
- Resource conflicts between parallel goals
- How to prevent conflicting code changes
- Communication between AI agents working on different goals

**Suggestions**:
- Add guidance on when goals should be sequential vs. parallel
- Suggest using git branches for experimental/conflicting goals
- Add a `teamwerx conflicts` command to detect potential issues
- Recommend limiting in-progress goals to prevent confusion

### 7. Error Recovery

**Issue**: The specification doesn't address:
- What happens when a task fails during execution
- How to roll back failed changes
- How to resume interrupted plans

**Suggestions**:
- Add task-level error tracking
- Support task retries and rollback
- Add a `teamwerx resume` command
- Track task dependencies (some tasks may need to be redone if prerequisites fail)

### 8. Testing and Validation

**Issue**: No mention of:
- How to validate that success criteria are met
- Whether automated tests should be part of the workflow
- How to verify goal completion

**Suggestions**:
- Add optional `validation_commands` to goal schema (e.g., test scripts)
- Add `teamwerx verify` command to check success criteria
- Integrate with existing test frameworks
- Support both manual and automated verification

### 9. Artifact Archiving

**Issue**: The spec mentions archiving completed goals but doesn't specify:
- When archiving should happen
- How archived goals are accessed
- Whether archived goals count toward limits

**Suggestions**:
- Add `teamwerx archive <goal>` command
- Move archived goals to `.teamwerx/archive/`
- Exclude archived goals from default `list` output
- Add `--include-archived` flag to list command

### 10. Configuration Extension

**Issue**: The spec says configuration is minimal for token efficiency, but there may be user preferences:
- Default goal status
- Commit message templates
- Preferred AI agent behaviors

**Suggestions**:
- Support optional `.teamwerx/config.yml` for user preferences
- Keep AGENTS.md frontmatter minimal (only what AI agents need)
- Allow overrides via environment variables or CLI flags

## Minor Issues

1. **File Naming**: Goal files use kebab-case, which is good. Consider enforcing this in validation.

2. **Date Formats**: Spec uses ISO 8601 dates. Consider being more specific (YYYY-MM-DD vs full timestamp).

3. **Task IDs**: Plan tasks use numeric IDs. Consider UUIDs for better tracking and merging.

4. **Success Criteria Format**: Currently a list of strings. Consider adding optional validation rules or acceptance tests.

5. **Research Directory Structure**: Each goal has a separate research directory, which is good. Consider adding templates.

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Phase 1** (Essential):
   - Implement validation for goal state transitions
   - Add templates for AI-generated artifacts
   - Clarify proposal workflow
   - Add dependency tracking

2. **Phase 2** (Important):
   - Implement state transition commands
   - Add validation/verification commands
   - Add archive functionality
   - Improve error recovery

3. **Phase 3** (Nice to have):
   - Add conflict detection
   - Add progress visualization
   - Add analytics/metrics
   - Add export/import functionality

## Conclusion

The teamWERX specification is well-designed and addresses a real need for structured AI-assisted development. The suggested improvements would:
- Reduce ambiguity for implementers
- Improve error handling and recovery
- Make the tool more robust for real-world use
- Better support the multi-goal, multi-agent workflow

The core concepts are solid - these suggestions are mostly about adding clarity, validation, and practical workflow support.
